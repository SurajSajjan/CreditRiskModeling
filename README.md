# CreditRiskModeling

Machine Learning Model to predict if a customer is going to default his credit payment.

The dataset can be found from the following webiste - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients.

Data Summary:

The dataset contains the various attributes of the bank customers and if they defaulted payment of the previous month. 

Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed upon data wrangling. Feature engineering has been performed and Machine Learning Models have been build including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Gradient Boosting and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. With an F1 socre of 52% in identifying Credit Defaulters, the Random Forest Classifier seems to be the best model in this Scenerio.
